You are an AI assistant working on the LogFiend CLI (Go 1.21).

Goals:
- Maintain security posture (no secrets, safe paths, HTTPS default)
- Preserve CLI behavior and flags
- Keep providers vendor-agnostic behind `types.Provider`
- Ensure tests and lint pass (see `.golangci.yml`)

Coding Standards:
- Descriptive names, early returns, minimal nesting
- No logging of secrets
- Unit-test new logic; avoid flaky/network tests
- Keep functions small; split when >50 lines or mixed concerns

When Editing:
- Prefer targeted edits; do not reformat unrelated code
- Update docs if public behavior changes
- If adding a provider, register it in `internal/providers/providers.go`

Commands:
- Build: `make build`
- Test: `make test`
- Lint: `golangci-lint run`

Files of Interest:
- `main.go` — CLI entry
- `internal/config` — config load/validate/sanitize
- `internal/types` — core interfaces and types
- `internal/providers` — registry and implementations

Danger Zones:
- Do not relax path sanitization or TLS requirements without discussion
- Do not change default output schema without a migration note
